project_description: The main function of HyFI-ABSA is to facilitate Aspect-Based
    Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), a specialized form of sentiment analysis that allows
    you to evaluate specific components or aspects of a given text. It also performs
    general sentiment analysis tasks. One feature of the HyFI-ABSA package is its
    capacity to employ generative language models for creating training datasets.
    This feature not only eliminates the extensive manual labor typically associated
    with data collection and preparation, but also ensures a more diverse and balanced
    dataset, which subsequently improves the overall performance and accuracy of sentiment
    analysis. In addition to these primary features, HyFI-ABSA boasts seamless integration
    with the existing HyFI architecture, thus allowing you to effortlessly combine
    it with other HyFI plugins and tools.
